One problem snow detection runs into is the similarity between snow and clouds. Unsupervised methods based on color often classify clouds as also being snow, but this issue is solved through the use of deep learning and some more heavy-handed techniques. Neural networks can learn not to depend only on color but instead on other information such as texture. To help the network along we also cropped out the sky from the images in addition to other transforms such as solarization. Solarization randomly reverses the brightness of pixels over a certain threshold so it cannot depend on which pixels are very bright. These changes force the model to learn to recognize snow on the ground through additional attributes in addition to color."}),"\n",(0,a.jsxs)(t.p,{children:['Our goal was to create a machine learning model that could detect whether there was snow on the ground around the river. Convolutional neural networks are the main tool of choice for these kinds of image related tasks.
