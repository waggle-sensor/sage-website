Instead, ground-based images have been used predominantly for analyzing local cloud status which can affect on estimation and prediction of solar irradiance.

To train each of machine learning models with various sky conditions, we created a cloud dataset that can reinforce dark sky conditions and overcast on Singapore whole Sky imaging segmentation (SWIMSEG) dataset using a Waggle node deployed in Argonne National Laboratory.
