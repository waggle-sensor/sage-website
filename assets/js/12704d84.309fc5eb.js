However, as they are so close to human lives, there are also multifarious problems that vehicles are involved with, such as traffic congestion, vehicle theft and trafficking, and hit-and-run. One way to deal with those vehicle-related problems is to track each vehicle. An intelligent traffic surveillance system that could track each vehicle and figure out the trajectory of each vehicle will play a significant role in various tasks such as traffic flow analysis or catching hit-and-run criminals.

To address such issue, Leal-Taixe \u0301 et al. have launched Multiple Object Tracking Challenge (MOTChallenge) in 2015, in order to provide a novel multiple object tracking benchmark, which consists of a large-scale well-annotated dataset and a unified evaluation framework for effective quantification of multi-object tracking."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Since the first MOTChallenge, a significant number of researchers have participated and contributed to the challenge, proposing state-of-the-art tracking algorithms, and there is an obvious trend in submitted algorithms.
