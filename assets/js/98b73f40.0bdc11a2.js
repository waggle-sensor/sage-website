So a Multi-Angle Snowflake Camera (MASC) is put in place which is ground-based and captures pictures of snow (or rain) falling from three different angles alongside their fall velocity. Conventionally, these images are classified into types of snowflakes based on different image processing methods. It includes elliptical approximations, morphological processing, extraction of geometrical features like projected area, rotational symmetry, texture operators, etc. But as they say, every snowflake is unique and so it is difficult to use one framework or technique for snowflake habit classification."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(n.p,{children:"This is where recent advent in Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques come to the save!

Data is the new fuel and quite expensive because more the data better the machine works. But in a task like this, it requires a lot of fieldwork in rough weather conditions and manual work to label the images for training, and so slowly and gradually the dataset can expand which will result in better classification results.
