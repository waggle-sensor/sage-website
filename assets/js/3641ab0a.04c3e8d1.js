The shape and distribution of clouds are not only important to modeling weather, but also to understand interactions between aerosol and cloud for weather research, and to develop environment forecasting models including radiation and cloud properties. Additionally, detecting and understanding cloud cover over the sky have been studied to estimate and forecast solar irradiance and performance of renewable solar photovoltaic energy generation. For this reason, examining solar irradiance in photovoltaic power grids has been investigated in many ways. Even though the purpose of each study is diverse, it is common that they have approached to analyze the magnitude of cloud coverage. In this context, answering how much cloud covers the sky is a striking problem along with other factors such as wind direction, speed, temperature, and other meteorological factors.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"past/lightning-science":{"id":"past/lightning-science","title":"Lightning Science","description":"Overview","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"past/monitoring-biodiversity":{"id":"past/monitoring-biodiversity","title":"Monitoring biodiversity using acoustic data","description":"The Big Picture","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"past/snowflake":{"id":"past/snowflake","title":"Snowflake Classification","description":"Hello!

These nodes have the potential of capturing photos with important features such as smoke, wildlife, and emergencies. Each image contains unique characteristics which, until now, were hard to look for without manually searching through the Sage database. With both the images and users in mind, this project has two goals: harness the power of machine learning to describe photos as they are taken, and build a user-friendly system to allow others to find what they are looking for within our database.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"recent/lidar-sky-solar":{"id":"recent/lidar-sky-solar","title":"Using LIDAR to Aid Models in Solar Estimation and Sky Classification","description":"LIDAR technology, with its ability to create detailed maps of atmospheric environments, can potentially solve the issue of blockers by providing precise information about the location and height of obstructions. It proposes many benefits that can\u2019t be offered by a regular camera, especially the fact that it provides accurate data in all different types of weather conditions including fog, rain, and low light. This information can be used to adjust solar irradiance estimates and sky predictions, making them more accurate in any setting. Current models experience difficulties in the presense of blockers and unfamiliar sky conditions. We believe LiDAR can potentially solve this issue and allow us to deploy these nodes in urban areas.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"recent/lightning-detector":{"id":"recent/lightning-detector","title":"Lightning Detection with Software Defined Radio","description":"Lightning causes significant damage, starts wildfires, and poses a threat to human safety.

This study is a continuation of the work done by UCSD and their SmokeyNet deep learning architecture for smoke detection[1]. We compared performance of deep learning models, in order to find the best model for this issue, and to find if a simple model can compare to a complex model.
