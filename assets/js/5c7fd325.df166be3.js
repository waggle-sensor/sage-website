When the electric field is so large that electrons can be liberated from air molecules (approximately 10000 Volts over a centimeter) the resulting current channel formed dissipates energy in the form of light, heat and sound (thunder).

There are also a slew of commercial solutions on the market. Since EM techniques use time of flight for geolocation more than one detector is needed (HLMA uses 12). This presents a logistical hurdle to testing of new (perhaps more affordable) lightning detection technologies. Enter Sage! By providing edge compute and network cyberinfrastructure across geospatially diverse regions scientists can  bring their own technologies. A fun and very affordable technology are Software Defined Radios (",(0,s.jsx)(t.a,{href:"https://www.rtl-sdr.com/",children:"for example the RTL-SDR"}),"). A cheap SDR can tune to frequencies from 30MHz to 3GHz and even lower frequencies with upconverters. While digitization rates are less than ideal at ~2.5Ms/s (HLMA operates at 25Ms/s) this gives a spatial accuracy (basically divide by the speed of light) of 100m which is not bad for a $35 device.
