We used images captured on May through August 2022 because of the change of the trajectory of sun and maximum solar irradiance that is changing based on the trajectory. We assumed that the trajectory would not change significantly therefore the solar irradiance would be in relevantly similar range. We used solar irradiance measurement from a sensor deployed on Argonne Weather Observatory as a matching set with the images. The solar irradiance measurement is reported every 15 minute while the node took a picture once every hour. We matched image and measurement data based on their timestamp and this gave us a collection of about 4000 images to work with.
