We collected street images from three different nodes deployed at intersections in Chicago. We used a COCO trained YOLO v7 model to detect vehicles and used OpenCV to overlay rideshare stickers on windshield of vehicle images manually. We randomly chose rideshare stickers of Uber, Lyft, and TNP (Chicago Transportation Network Providers) with random opacity, darkness and perspective warp to make the stickers look realistic. This gave us a collection of 2960 images to work with. The nodes took a picture once every hour, so some images were at night and too dark to see.
