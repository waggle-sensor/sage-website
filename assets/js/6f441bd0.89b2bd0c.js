Before joining NIU, I worked for 2 years in a Florida based startup as a research and development manager. There, my role was to design and build computer vision and machine learning based yard management system that automatically tracks the vehicles inside a freight yard.  At NIU, I am deeply interested in solving complex real-life problems by employing computer science tools and techniques, especially artificial intelligence and computer vision. While working at Argonne National Lab in summer 2020, I worked on to design and build an AI-enabled computer vision system that counts the pedestrians who violate the crosswalk while crossing the street. The goal of this project is 3-fold; first \u2013 detect every pedestrian in the image, second \u2013 re-identify the pedestrian in successive frames to avoid their recounting, third \u2013 count the pedestrians who do not follow the crosswalk. A sample output image from the project is shown in Figure 1.","date":"2021-02-12T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"AI applications","permalink":"/news/tags/ai-applications"},{"inline":true,"label":"NIU","permalink":"/news/tags/niu"}],"readingTime":10.47,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Pratool Bharti","title":"Assistant Professor, Dept. of Computer Science, Northern Illinois University","url":"https://pratoolbharti.github.io/NIU/","imageURL":"https://pratoolbharti.github.io/NIU/images/profile.png","key":null,"page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Pedestrian Count for Crosswalk Violations","author":"Pratool Bharti","author_title":"Assistant Professor, Dept. of Computer Science, Northern Illinois University","author_url":"https://pratoolbharti.github.io/NIU/","author_image_url":"https://pratoolbharti.github.io/NIU/images/profile.png","tags":["AI applications","NIU"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Scalable AI@Edge at Argonne\'s Advanced Photon Source","permalink":"/news/2023/05/31/scalable-ci-in-aps"}}')}}]);
