Floods cause death, damages crop, and properties. With the rise in global warming, many parts of the world are suffering from recurrent floods and excessive rainfall. Deaths due to flooding are often associated with excessive rainfall, which leads to flash flooding. Due to the devastating nature of floods and flash floods, there is a clear need for constant observation of the water level in the rivers and streams. An adequate solution would be the one that is cost-effective, automated, and requires low maintenance. With the advances in computer vision, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and edge computing there is a necessity of algorithms that can be deployed on low-cost powerful computers at data generation locations.

One image with a clear view at the bottom part of the bridge becomes the reference image. Images collected from the node are initially processed to identify whether it is a day or night image. Further, I employed a template matching algorithm to find the bridge in the image. The template matching algorithm helps to find an object in a new image based on a pre-defined template.  It works best when the template image and new image looks very similar. Since RGB/color image changes drastically under different light and weather conditions, we converted them into grayscale edge-detection images. The edges are extracted by applying the Holistically-Nested Edge Detection (HED)",(0,i.jsxs)("sup",{children:["[",(0,i.jsx)(t.a,{href:"#references",children:"3"}),"]"]})," algorithm to the image. A template of the bottom part of the bridge is obtained from the reference image (water level information is pre-determined). This template is further used to find the location of the bridge in the images. By matching the template, the water coordinates are obtained based on the pixel values\u2019 variations within the image. This whole process is applied to the reference image. Linear Regression is applied to the coordinates to obtain the waterline of the template to derive a reference waterline. Waterline for the new images is obtained by utilizing Linear Regression combined with a sliding window concept. The water level change is the difference between the reference water line and the water line detected in the image.
