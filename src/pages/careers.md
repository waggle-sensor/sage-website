# Join the Sage Team
At the frontier of AI, intelligence sensing, and cyberinfrastructure, the Sage Grande project is building
a next-generation network of AI-enabled sensor nodes that are transforming how we study and respond to the
natural world. With deployments in some of the most iconic and ecologically significant locations in the
U.S.—from the volcanic landscapes of Hawai‘i Volcanoes National Park to the alpine ecosystems of the
Grand Tetons—Sage is more than just technology. It’s a mission-driven effort to accelerate discovery,
understand our environment, and train the next generation of scientists and engineers.

We’re combining real-time edge AI, wireless sensors, and advanced computing to build AI-powered
infrastructure that can detect wildfires and floods, monitor ecosystem resilience, and support
agriculture facing drought and other extreme weather challenges. As part of the team,
you’ll have the opportunity to shape cutting-edge research, mentor students,
develop new technologies, and collaborate with a passionate, interdisciplinary community.
Education is central to our work, and we’re building systems that not only power scientific
discovery, but also create learning opportunities in rural communities and urban centers alike.

If you’re excited about AI for good, open science, and working in an environment where your
code might one day run on a node watching for wildfires in a remote canyon or
tracking data in a coastal wetland—then Sage is the place for you. Read more at [About Sage](/about).
