# Sage Field Experience in Hawai'i

Sponsored by [NAISE](https://naise.northwestern.edu), the primary goal for the SAGE visit in Hawai’i was centered around experiential learning. Engaging directly with the local communities and university scientists on the island, we learned about traditional aquaculture farming practices, successfully deployed a [Wild Sage Node](https://portal.sagecontinuum.org/node/W097) in Pāhoa for climate research, surveyed future deployment areas needed to fulfill data needs in Lahaina, and more. This immersive field experience combined scientific exploration with community, highlighting the critical importance of conducting science that drives actionable impact and social change.
