Sage is a cutting-edge cyberinfrastructure testbed funded by the NSF Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure to support AI research. The platform provides real-time environmental monitoring and AI-enabled edge computing at a national scale. By bringing advanced AI to the edge, where data is collected, full-resolution analysis, dynamic automation, and immediate actionable responses can be computed. Each Sage node includes a GPU and AI-optimized software stack connected to instruments such as infrared cameras, RGB cameras, LIDAR, and traditional sensors for air quality and wind, as well as LoRaWAN connected sensors for low-bandwidth measurements such as soil moisture. With over **100 Sage nodes deployed across 17 states**, including fire-prone regions in the Western U.S., the platform supports rapid-response science and sustained observation of ecological systems, agriculture, urban environments, and weather-related hazards.
