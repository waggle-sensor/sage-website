# Getting Started with Sage

This guide can help you get started based on your specific needs and expertise.

### What is Sage?

Sage is a national AI research platform that brings artificial intelligence to the edge‚Äîright where data is collected in real time. Built around powerful, sensor-equipped nodes deployed in natural and urban environments, Sage allows scientists, students, and community partners to run AI directly in the field.
