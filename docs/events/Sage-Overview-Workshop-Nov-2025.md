## Pre-Workshop Preparation <small className="muted">(To be Determined)</small>

To make the most of the session, we might suggest completing the following ahead of time:
1. Read the [Getting Started Guide](/docs/getting-started) to understand how Sage might connect to your work.
2. Assemble your team members who plan to participate.
3. Ensure everyone has a Sage account: [Create an Account](/docs/getting-started#creating-an-account)
4. If applicable, begin the [Edge Apps Tutorial](https://sagecontinuum.org/docs/tutorials/edge-apps/intro-to-edge-apps).

During the workshop, we'll walk through the Sage portal and key parts of the Edge Apps tutorial. Completing some prep work beforehand will allow us to focus on supporting your unique applications and questions.

We look forward to seeing you there!
